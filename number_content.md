Teaching considerations
Number structure › record, compare, and order
whole and decimal numbers
using scientific notation
(e.g., 3.14 × 103)
› record, compare, and order
whole and decimal numbers,
including those represented by
negative powers in scientific
notation (e.g., “Which is larger,
7.35 × 10-3 or 0.008?”)
Demonstrate scientific notation for numbers where the coefficient is
between 1 and 10 and the powers of ten are integer exponents only.
Represent very large numbers and very small numbers with scientific
notation.
Explore the use of scientific notation in the mathematics strands
(e.g., limits of accuracy in measurement, or significant figures in
number) and in other learning areas (e.g., science).
Investigate contextual situations that students are familiar with
(e.g., other learning areas’ use of very small or large numbers, or
population growth in the news).
› identify special properties of
numbers, including cube roots
of cube numbers up to 1,000
Demonstrate exponential growth of whole numbers, explaining the
relationship between base, power, and root (e.g., 23 = 8, √8 = 2).
Represent cube numbers and other exponential numbers in exponential
form, generalising that the base is the root (e.g., 25 = 32, √32 = 2).
Operations › use rounding and estimation to
predict results and to check the
reasonableness of calculations
› use rounding and estimation to
predict results and to check the
reasonableness of calculations
Use word problems and practical situations outside the classroom,
ensuring that the magnitude of numbers involved is appropriate to the
year level.
› round to the degree of precision
required for the context
› round to the degree of precision
required for the context
Connect with measurement and other practical situations.
› express remainders as fractions
or decimals, depending on the
context
Represent and make sense of remainders as fractions, as decimals, and
when rounded to the nearest whole number, using number lines and
diagrams.

Teaching considerations
Operations › evaluate expressions with
positive whole number
exponents, using the order of
operations
› evaluate expressions using the
order of operations
(e.g., 2 − 32
2 )
Demonstrate a mnemonic such as GEMA (grouped, exponents,
multiplicative, additive), and common errors.
Investigate:
› the order of operations – why it is used, and what happens when it is
not followed
› situations in familiar contexts, to reinforce students’ skills in practical
situations (e.g., using number operation skills in measurement and
algebra problems and in financial mathematics)
› operations that involve square roots with exponents
(e.g., √32 + 42 ≠ 3 + 4)
› operating on numbers with whole-number exponents, including
powers with negative numbers (e.g., (−1)4 = 1).
› add and subtract integers,
multiply integers using repeated
addition or subtraction, and
divide integers by reversing a
multiplication (e.g., −12 ÷ 3 = −4,
since 3 × −4 = −12)
› add, subtract, multiply, and
divide positive and negative
numbers, including fractions
and decimals
Represent operations on number lines and with two-sided counters,
connecting with practical situations.
Investigate:
› multiplicative inverses with negative numbers (e.g., 1
−b = − 1
b )
› how multiplication and division as inverse operations extend to
negative numbers (e.g., 3 × −2 = −6) and families of facts
› practical situations outside the classroom that use integers
(e.g., sea level or temperature)
› why division by a fraction is equivalent to multiplication by its
reciprocal.
Generalise relationships between positive and negative integers using
the commutative, associative, and distributive properties.
Explain and justify the effect of dividing by numbers between 0 and 1.

Teaching considerations
Rational numbers › identify, read, write, represent,
compare, order, and convert
between fractions, decimals,
and percentages
› identify, read, write, represent,
compare, order, and convert
between fractions, decimals,
and percentages
Represent fractions, decimals, and percentages on number lines and
100s squares. Demonstrate the use of flow diagrams in conversions.
Investigate:
› fractions, decimals, and percentages as equivalent representations
of the same values
› practical situations where fractions, decimals, percentages, rates,
and ratios are used.
› find equivalent fractions,
simplify fractions, and convert
between improper fractions
and mixed numbers
› find equivalent fractions,
simplify fractions, and convert
between improper fractions
and mixed numbers
Use factors trees to investigate highest common factors and lowest
common multiples.
Explain that ‘improper’ is just a technical term for ‘top-heavy’ fractions,
which are a useful format for working with fractions.
› find a fraction or percentage
of a number, and increase
or decrease a number by a
fraction or percentage
› calculate the percentage
increase or decrease between
two numbers (e.g., “What is the
percentage increase between
50 and 75?”)
Demonstrate how to calculate a percentage increase or decrease with a
single decimal multiplier.
Investigate common and expected uses for percentage increases
and decreases outside the classroom (e.g., discounts, mark-ups, and
interest).
› find the whole amount, given a
fraction or percentage
(e.g., “20% of an amount is 30,
what is the original amount?”)
› find the whole amount, given a
fraction or percentage
(e.g., “15% of an amount is 27,
what is the original amount?”)
Represent backwards and forwards situations using flowcharts and bar
models.
Connect finding an original amount with forming and solving a linear
equation (e.g., 15
100x = 27).
› divide fractions by whole
numbers, and add, subtract,
and multiply fractions
Investigate reciprocals, equivalent fractions, and operations using
number lines.
› divide decimals by whole
numbers, and add, subtract,
and multiply decimals
Represent decimal numbers using place-value materials.
Connect operations with decimals to operations with whole numbers
and operations with fractions.
Explain and justify the effect of multiplying by numbers between 0 and 1.

Teaching considerations
Rational numbers › use ratios to share in unequal
proportions, and find equivalent
ratios and rates by scaling up
or down
› compare and use ratios and
rates
Connect ratios to fractions, explaining how the parts of the ratio can
become the numerators of corresponding fractions, and the sum of the
parts the denominator.
Investigate practical situations that use fractions and ratios.
Financial

› calculate profit, loss, and
discounts as absolute quantities
relative to an original amount
› convert NZ dollars into other
currencies (and vice versa) and
give examples of when this is
useful
Connect to operations that use decimals and, in year 10, operations
that use rates.
Investigate the number of decimal places and rounding in cash versus
electronic transactions.
› calculate simple interest and
GST on dollar amounts
(e.g., “Find 15% GST on $432”).
› find proportions of costs
(e.g., the price of 400 g of an
item when given the cost per
kilogram).
Connect to operations that use fractions, decimals, and percentages.
Investigate problems that involve accruing interest or budgeting to
make a savings target.
